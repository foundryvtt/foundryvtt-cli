## API

Certain internal functionality of the CLI is exposed as an API that can be imported into other projects.

### Example Usage

```js
import { compilePack, extractPack } from "@foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli";

// Extract a NeDB compendium pack.
await extractpack("mymodule/packs/actors.db", "mymodule/packs/src/actors", { nedb: true });

// Compile a LevelDB compendium pack.
await compilePack("mymodule/packs/src/actors", "mymodule/packs/actors");
```

### `compilePack(src: string, dest: string, options?: object): Promise<void>`

Compile source files into a compendium pack.

#### Parameters

* **src:** *string* The directory containing the source files.
* **dest:** *string* The target compendium pack.
* **options:** *object*
  * **nedb:** *boolean = false* Whether to operate on a NeDB database, otherwise a LevelDB database is assumed.
  * **yaml:** *boolean = false* Whether the source files in YAML format, otherwise JSON is assumed.
  * **log:** *boolean = false* Whether to log operation progress to the console.
  * **recursive:** *boolean = false* Whether to recurse into child directories under **src**, otherwise only source files located directly under **src** will be used.
  * **transformEntry:** *(entry: object): Promise<false|void>* A function that is called on every entry. Returning *false* indicates that the entry should be discarded.

### `extractPack(src: string, dest: string, options?: object): Promise<void>`

Extract the contents of a compendium pack into individual source files for each primary Document.

#### Parameters

* **src:** *string* The source compendium pack.
* **dest:** *string* The directory to write the extracted files into.
* **options:** *object*
    * **nedb:** *boolean = false* Whether to operate on a NeDB database, otherwise a LevelDB database is assumed.
    * **yaml:** *boolean = false* Whether the source files in YAML format, otherwise JSON is assumed.
    * **yamlOptions** *object = {}* Options to pass to `yaml.dump`.
    * **log:** *boolean = false* Whether to log operation progress to the console.
    * **documentType:** *string* For NeDB operations, a **documentType** must be provided. This should be the same as the pack's *type* field in the *module.json* or *system.json*.
    * **transformEntry:** *(entry: object): Promise<false|void>* A function that is called on every entry. Returning *false* indicates that the entry should be discarded.
    * **transformName:** *(entry: object): Promise<string|void>* A function that is called on every entry. The value returned from this will be used as the entry's filename. If nothing is returned, an auto-generated name will be used instead.
